[androidJvm]\
var [currentValue](current-value.md): [T](index.md)

The current value of the state.

If no swipe or animation is in progress, this corresponds to the anchor at which the [swipeable](../swipeable.md) is currently settled. If a swipe or animation is in progress, this corresponds the last anchor at which the [swipeable](../swipeable.md) was settled before the swipe or animation started.
