# dismissDirection

[androidJvm]\
val [dismissDirection](dismiss-direction.md): [DismissDirection](../-dismiss-direction/index.md)?

The direction (if any) in which the composable has been or is being dismissed.

If the composable is settled at the default state, then this will be null. Use this to change the background of the [SwipeToDismiss](../-swipe-to-dismiss.md) if you want different actions on each side.
